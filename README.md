# Assurance-Guarantee-Data-Preprocessing-Visualization-and-Insights

## Overview:
Assurance Guarantee is a guarantee given by telkom to customers who experience interference so that they do not experience repeated interference within three months.

## Problem:
  1. Data processing still uses manual tools or has not been automated, namely using Spreadsheet or MS Excel.
  2. Data visualization for monitoring is not optimal, only using the pivot table feature from Spreadsheet or MS Excel in the form of a table.

## Solution:
  1. Data processing is done by creating an automated program from Pyhton Programming and stored in Spreadsheet to make it more effective and efficient.
  2. Data visualization or dashboard creation using Looker Studio so that the dashboard created is more interactive for monitoring or analysis.

## Objectives:
  1. Data Preprocessing (Data Preparation & Data Cleansing),
     - Create an end-to-end data processing automation program using python programming to process data according to analysis needs more quickly and easily before entering data visualization.
  2. Data Visualization (Visualizations, Insights, and Actions)
     - Create interactive dashboards that contain attractive visualizations by adjusting the needs to facilitate analysis, monitoring, drawing insights / conclusions, and decision making. Visualizations displayed in the dashboard are metrics that are needed by related units and have been discussed previously.
